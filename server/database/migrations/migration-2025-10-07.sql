12	2	gcp@2	483	2025-04-23 16:05:36.797803	completed	And I said that Steve can go with it. OK, so this is understood. What is the only term that is still unclear to us is those syndication APIs, because it seems like what George, our VP of strategy, understood is that Google is kind of going to expose some kind of telecom aggregated network APIs, and we could be fulfilling some part of those APIs behind your syndicated APIs. But I'm getting a little bit here what's going on, because I'm familiar with the different solutions that exist. Yeah, yeah, understood. So this puts us back to the concept of basically a solution, and I gave in the previous discussion some aspects of that solution. We can basically be a little bit strategic or maybe selective in those solutions in the sense we don't need to bring all our solutions all of a sudden on the Google marketplace. So we need first to make sure that, one, the solution has success from our side. So something like branded calling, for example, has a lot of success from our side. We see a lot of interest. I can walk you through that. The second thing is it has to generate a substantial amount of workload on GCP. So that's also understood. We need to work through that and identify what's the percentage where we put the cursor. Is it 50-50? Is it 10-90? And then the other thing also is that we would like also to put a priority on anything that is related to AI agents and agentic workflows and this kind of stuff. So if we can take those three baselines basically as a way to put the next steps forward, then that would be great. We need also the feedback of your industry specialists in different areas like financial services and banking and maybe health care. These are the areas where we are pretty strong, actually. There's digital native. Anything that is digital native, we are pretty strong. And if we can have the feedback from those industry experts on what are the solutions that could make a lot of sense and that could be really successful, that will help us expedite the process and coming up with the solutions. Of course, ideally, we would like just to transpose what we have. And we know that it's working and it has traction in the market, like, as I said, branded quality, but we are open to other stuff. And basically transpose that into the Google Cloud environment. That would be the best maybe shortcut if you want to go that way. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. For FSI, we are focusing on the fraud protection angle. In the fraud protection, we find a number of things that we can bring to the table. First of all is the enhanced authentication, in the sense that with the network APIs, we are able to do silent authentication, which basically removes the friction of the one-time password. It removes the friction of the need to scan a QR code, like for a passkey, for example, or others. And then we are able to basically authenticate the user in a couple of seconds, no friction, and it's more secure than OTP. Because of course, when you send a code and then you ask the user to enter the code into the app, that's a loophole for social engineering. So silent authentication is very good. We can just build a case around that where, for example, an AI agent who is sitting on the call center, whether on chat or on voice, is interacting with the user. So the caller is the user. The caller says, I'm Morsi, for example, and I have this bank account. And before transferring that call to the human agent to manipulate, for example, to manipulate sensitive operations, like a bank transaction or changing the address or something like that, before doing that, the agent is capable of saying, hey, Mr. Morsi, I'm going to send you an OTP, and I'm going to do the silent authentication as well. And so we can have that security part taken care of the agent instead of wasting the time of the human agent. This is one of the applications. And also, just to give an example, yes, they are. And we see this also as more than a two-play solution. Two-play, yes, for digital natives and for companies who have an engineering powerhouse. For those who do not have that, we need a partner. And that partner could be either Google Cloud, you guys, if you have a professional services team, that's great. We can use them. Otherwise, we are also developing really strategic connections to the GSIs, like the Accenture, the Wipro, and Capgemini, including aligning on multiple industries, which is really very hard, I can tell you. But basically, what we can do is to have a three-play setup where we provide the APIs, the native APIs, the network APIs. We provide the templates, the support, and the training. The GSI builds the whole solution for the customer and runs it for the customer, all of that running on the GCP Cloud. And I think that's a very winning model, actually. We have tested it, and it's working. Yeah, we have something similar. But ideally, the blueprint needs to be repeatable, so the GSIs don't create an SOW that is very expensive. There needs to be. And again, I think on our side, we have PSO where the solution is highly repeatable. So it seems to me that as a next step, what we need to do is maybe a half-day workshop where we do a discovery. And we bring maybe some customer cases where we show you what this customer did, how this customer implemented this, what we can do, et cetera. And then based on that, we can strategize on what solutions to start with and what do we need to do to get that solution on the marketplace. And of course, there will be an assessment of how much workload we bring to GCP based on that solution. Does this sound like a good next step? Yeah, it's valuable for everybody. Yeah. But the idea of the workgroup. Yeah, so ideally, of course, we need this team here for the marketplace direction and guidance. We need also to have people who have industry insights. It could be generic. We don't need someone who is really specialized in financial services and another one who's really specialized in health care, but someone who has enough visibility on what's going on in those industries so that we can maybe shortlist three solutions. And then from those three solutions, we say, this is the one that we are going to focus on. And then we start execution. And by the way, I'm open to other suggestions.

So we should really take a focus on getting RCS ready for Poland. So this was one of the most popular demos, showing them our RCS demos. As well, Brendan Calling was very interested for the finance sector. They were interested on that as well. So the fraud issue, having scam calls and using our solution basically to help them, this is what they saw as well. So that's, I would say, network APIs was too abstract sometimes. But these two points, we're very interested for them. Yeah, and that concurs with the voice demo itself. I couldn't really show. It was just too loud, too noisy. Yeah, it wasn't really working because it was stuck all the time. Yeah, and there were also those silly questions like, hey, do you have the mobile numbers? Do you have voice connectivity? I think this was cash director who asked for simple things like numbers, voice. By the way, do you have connectivity to Amazon Connect? So I think this Amazon Connect is another thing to really polish all the rustic tasks because we realized we don't really have a video connector for Amazon Connect. It's like very old WebRTC, not fancy part. So maybe if we don't have Genesis Friendship anymore, we should go for Amazon Connect. That's my gut feeling. That's what I hear from the market. A lot of banks, I think to Vojtech, ask about Amazon Connect. Yeah, I'm wondering whether AWS Connect is open for external connections. Yeah, they are. I mean, it's all API and SDK based.

Is it is it silent authentication mostly plus identity insight? Or are you thinking of something more centered on network API's? Okay. Okay, I'm just, I'm just trying to see if we can work together on the best pitch possible in terms of how to connect card fraud, which is the initial topic to all what we have on the table, including or not branded coding. Yeah, I don't know if the head of fraud is specifically also censure to what they're trying to, what they're trying to. Yeah, I mean, what are they trying to solve at the end of the day? What is the card fraud? What is it? Yeah. And I mean, we have only we have 15 minutes, which is good and good enough at the same time, because we will need like probably, at least three to five minutes to introduce Vonage because nobody knows Vonage in the banking space, especially in terms of fraud. So it's important that we introduce Vonage and we describe the connection to Ericsson. That's a very strong connection for us. But then we have basically 10 minutes, including questions to present whatever solutions that we want. So I think if you are okay, let me get back to Accenture, ask them more specifically about what needs to be presented there among the three topics. So the three topics that we are coming up with are branded calling and branded communications, by the way, using RCS plus silent authentication and verify. And then the last one is insights. Basically, these are the three offerings that we are talking about. So yeah, we should we shouldn't play up the insights too much more. So because yeah, yeah, absolutely. So that leaves us basically branded calling and silent authentication slash verify. Or what problem is that I seen within fraud? Because yeah, it's just a broad term. I mean, we could we could be hitting, you know, we could hit the man on the head with some of our stuff, or it might be something. Yeah, totally. Let me shoot that email right after this call. So that's great. And then if we finished about HSBC, I would like to dedicate five minutes on for Barclays. Is that is that okay to switch to that? Yeah, of course. Yeah, because my understanding is that we had the call the last time. And the lady that we were in front of was basically the fraud person. For some reason, she didn't take on branded calling and said that she needs to engage a different team. So what is the next step there? And what can we do in order to progress on that? Okay, so that's, that's a very good thing to know. So, so that in that case, I will send two emails, one email about HSBC trying to focus on what is the key messaging that the person, his name is apparently is David Callington or something like that, who can basically, you know, and give us what is the direction that we need to focus on, knowing that we have 15 minutes. And then the other one, the other request is to follow up on Barclays to understand who is the next person that we need to speak to and also invite a follow up with that person. Yeah, they only know that it sticks with the customers. That's the only thing that they know. That is fine. Okay, that's great. So I'm gonna follow up with those two emails right now. And then we'll see what comes after that after it. My suggestion is that unless you want to handle this on your own, the two of you, that's totally fine. My job is to bring you opportunities and you have to, I bring the bear, you have to slice it. But I think we can also have operate in a different model, where we can work as a team to bring ideas and to define really what is the direction to do, even if at the end, it's going to be just you two who presented. I think it makes sense that we operate as a team there. But I totally understand whatever direction you want to take. We can always set up some internal calls. Yeah, let's follow up on a call on Wednesday. And in the meanwhile, we would have received the answer from Accenture. So that will give us direction on where to go from there. And basically, yeah, we have everything that we will need.\n	{"overview": {"score": 65, "rating": "Average", "summary": "The speaker's communication is grounded in collaboration and clarity, with moments of effective group discussion emphasis.

If we can do that, and while remaining under the same AWS account organization, then this is the best deal. The other deal is that we keep our organization, but we create a specific account for Vonage Limited, because that account will not be incurring costs, it will be only to collect revenues. So worse comes to worse, it's okay, we're not going to pay anything on that account. It's just to collect money and send them to the bank information that we will be specifying in this step. So one thing is, we won't be able to, if we decide to do that. Okay, so this is a very good, very good step forward. So it means that we don't need to create a new organization, we will remain under our own organization, the same thing. The question is whether are we able to create an AWS account that is attached to another entity than Vonage United States. That's the trouble, there is no documentation. There is of course, the AWS documentation here. So basically, what it says is that if you need to create a marketplace seller account, then these are the requirements, you need to be in one of those countries. Okay. So you need to be in the European Union, or the United Kingdom. But that's basically saying what we want to achieve, not how we are going to achieve it under our organization or not. The process would be great if we can have it systematically or globally for many accounts, because we have also other Vonage entities around the globe, and we want to make sure that we use those entities. I think Australia or something like that, I'm not sure about which state or which country, but there are other countries where we have Vonage presence as well. Okay, so in… That is correct, we are going to use that account only to collect revenues, meaning that when there is a transaction on the marketplace, AWS will be paying us after the customer has paid for that service or for that product. And once the AWS receives the funds from the customer, they will be paying us attached to the, as I said, in that definition of the marketplace, we are going to add a bank account, which is the bank account that we have for the UK. And then we will have yet another one for Vonage BV. So this is in Netherlands, and we will have an account also in Netherlands to support that operation. But normally, we will not incur any costs at all. Both cases, it's both. I mean, this account is only to receive money, not to pay for AWS services. Okay. Yeah, that is fantastic. So thank you so much, Meena. And of course, if you need me to open a ticket, unless this is done already, maybe I have already opened a ticket to that. But if you need me to open a ticket, let me know. Oh, sure. I'll let you know. Yeah, I'll have to get some background information on the AWS marketplace account, how it is set up and then how we did it for the existing accounts. So I'll have to read through that. But I'll also confirm with my team if somebody is aware of it. And if needed, I'll let you know. We can also involve the AWS teams as well. So we have Niv, who is our solution architect. And we have also our account manager, I forgot his name. Maybe Ankit, if I'm not mistaken. I think Ankit, something like that. Yeah. So we can involve them into the discussion if you want. I can send an email asking them that so that they do the work for us. Sure, sure. All righty. Thank you very much. So you have the URL of the marketplace. I think you have access to that. And then again, I think you send it last thing, but we should link just in case. And then we are good. Yes. Okay. No, no, no, no. Okay. All righty. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay. I don't have anything else right now, but I'll get back to you shortly. Yeah, thank you very much. Let's get some clarity, first of all, and then we can decide what to do as a next step. So that's perfect. All right. Well, thank you very much, team. Thank you, guys. All right. Bye now.

I had never experienced that before. Thanks to Atlanta and the fans, I feel like I'm being reborn in the football world.

In that moment when the goalkeeper put the ball, after our last attempt, he didn't see me standing behind him. I moved towards him, and when he released the ball, I rushed in and kicked the ball out of the bridge. He was surprised and followed me, but I was able to turn and shoot into the empty net, scoring a great goal. After that, I went straight to celebrate the goal. I was fired up.

I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially days of our lives, around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan. We'd hitch up the Airstream to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents, and I really looked forward to these trips. On one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was driving, and my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell. At that age, I'd take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I'd calculate our gas mileage, figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending. I'd been hearing an ad campaign about smoking. I can't remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life. I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per day, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette, and so on. When I was satisfied that I'd come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, at two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off of your life.\n	{"overview": {"score": 75, "rating": "Good", "summary": "The speaker effectively uses storytelling to convey personal experiences and make an emotional connection.

The only big advantage of that QIIME SDK is that it's cheap. That's it. That's the most important advantage. All the rest, I think we beat them to death. So basically, our play is to say, yeah, it's cheap, or we are maybe a high value solution because it delivers higher value to you. This is our play, I think. Yeah, I think if it is in ACE, then that's good. I will just mark it as opportunity in one. So are we closing this quarter or next quarter? Okay. Yeah. It's fine if it is not in the marketplace for now, for maybe a few months right now. But it's great. It's still great because when we share those opportunities, this is how we generate all of those discussions with AWS. Now it's our job now to convert those discussions and those conversations into new opportunities and new wins for us. And I think the process is working. So this is really great, in my opinion. Sorry, which one? AXA B, I think it's already in ACE. Yeah, yeah, it's already in ACE. We just need to find out when to close it. Okay. No, I haven't received any recently. Yeah, but that's behind us now. That's solved.

You won't be there before probably three six months on the other hand if she focuses on the overall picture And I tried to share with her a very simple, you know Matrix actually saying here are the key topics Here are the states where we would want to go and let's make sure that we are converging to those You don't care about the specific actions Just make sure that we convert everything that is red into green and then that's it. Okay, so I had that idea only Probably a couple of days before she left because I felt that she was overwhelmed But I think we can maybe help her providing her some either some tools or some coaching from that direction, what do you think? Yeah You Yeah, because we are only a few weeks away from the readiness, so we really would like to get that by mid of July and One of the things for example where I wanted to coach her is that for example, she was saying to everybody Hey, we have this deadline we have to meet the deadline You have to bring me your feedback before the end of June for example, and I told her instead of doing that Let's let's express it in a different way Let's say this is where we want to go. Don't give a timeline Give me your best ETA Okay, and guess what? We did it before the end of the month Before the end of June and the reason behind it is that when you give a deadline or a timeline in the heads of some of the people they will automatically Set their project plan to that timeline. Whereas if you tell them hey, just give me your ETA. When is it? Feasible for you. No stress. No pressure. Just give me your timeline I'm not going to impose a timeline on you And then all of a sudden you find out that most of the people will get back with a very achievable timeline Even better than what you would have imposed to them. So Yeah, so that was another experience as well Let's see if Justyna still needs some coaching or some help. I'm happy to help. I'm happy to step in So there is absolutely no problem.

Yeah. Okay. No, that's great. I'm glad that we are aligned on that So, let's see what the metering file and also the other thing is that whether the metering file includes already all the usages that we generated including Two types of usages. So the usages that Oscar generated for us during the weekend That's one. So does it have the time to catch up with the Export and the second is that Lucy also requested some I don't know how they call it, but kind of free current or services type of Fees as well. Oh, yeah, so these were also credited on the account So we do know So are you saying that these will be? visible only tomorrow Yeah, that goes up to AWS as $1,200 Yeah, and I'm not saying that's what she does Yeah, I'm not saying that I understood everything But I mean, let's let's see what the metering says and then we analyze and decide a quantity Hopefully everything goes as expected but if not, so We will review and and fix any deviation The only thing that I wanted to reassist on is that Let's do a metering today for both accounts. Make sure we're getting that Yeah, and then let's do another metering only for this second for this first API key tomorrow Okay, just just to see if there is a difference and Also to make sure at least we have this Customer number one totally compliant to what the accounting wants to set up actually Okay All right fantastic Excellent. Well, thank you Chris At least we've done your part So we're good with that and by the way, the calendar invite that I that I sent you it's not for a meeting It's just a reminder for both of us Yeah So that we know whether the metering file was good or not Fantastic.
