# Mobile Training System Implementation

## Issue: Complete Training System Implementation for ExpoClient

### **🎯 Objective**
Implement full training system functionality in the mobile app to achieve feature parity with the web client. The server-side infrastructure is 95% complete - only client-side implementation is needed.

### **📊 Current State Analysis**

#### **✅ Server Infrastructure (Complete)**
- All training endpoints implemented and functional
- AI evaluation system with multi-criteria scoring
- Complete training data (5 chapters, multiple modules, scenarios)
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Database persistence for attempts and evaluations

#### **❌ Mobile Client Gaps**
- Basic training tab with mock data only
- No situation-based training exercises
- No AI evaluation integration
- No progress persistence
- Missing 4 core training pages

### **🚀 Implementation Plan**

## **Phase 1: API Integration (Week 1)**

### **1.1 Remove Mock Data & Connect Real APIs**
- [ ] Update `app/(tabs)/training.tsx` to use real API endpoints

- [ ] Create detailed module/chapter analytics

### **4.3 Polish & Optimization**
- [ ] Add smooth animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Implement proper accessibility features
- [ ] Add offline support for training content
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching

## **🔧 Server Changes Required**

### **Missing Endpoint (1 item)**
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/training/next-situation-direct` endpoint
  - Add intelligent recommendation logic
  - Return next incomplete situation based on user progress
  - Handle completion scenarios

```typescript
// Server endpoint to add in routes/training.ts:
app.get("/api/training/next-situation-direct", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation needed for smart recommendations
});
```

## **📱 New Mobile Components Required**
